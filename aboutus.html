I grew up playing video games with friends and family. What's important to me is the larger impacts it has had on my life and how it shaped me to become who I am. I have always loved creating things if that would be through drawing or something else. If it weren't for video games, I would have never gotten into making music or programming. Games have been the catalyst for everything I make in my life."</p>
